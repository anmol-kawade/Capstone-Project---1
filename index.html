    <p>
        Hey! I’m Anmol Kawade, a passionate and driven IT student from Amrutvahini Polytechnic. I absolutely love coding—whether it’s Java, Python, C, or creating something cool on the web, I’m always excited to learn and build. I’m currently sharpening my skills through an internship at Technogrowth Software Solutions in Pune. After my diploma, I’m all set to pursue BCS and then MCS—I’m really looking forward to diving deeper into the world of tech and making something impactful!
